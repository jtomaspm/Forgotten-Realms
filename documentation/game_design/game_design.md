# 1. Game Overview

**Description:** Forgotten Realms is a massively multiplayer online real-time strategy (MMO-RTS) game set in a newly discovered world filled with ancient secrets and contested territories. Players choose from one of three playable factions, each with unique units, buildings, and heroes, and compete to dominate the realm. Alliances are central to gameplay, allowing players to support each other, engage in coordinated battles, and strive for realm-wide domination. A fourth, non-playable faction native to the Forgotten Realms serves as a common enemy, offering challenges and rewards.

**Platform:** Web browser

**Target Audience:** Strategy gamers, fans of persistent world games, ages 13+

# 2. Lore and Setting

The Forgotten Realms were long hidden from the known world until a rift was discovered. Now, empires from distant lands have ventured through, seeking to claim this bountiful and mysterious land. However, the realm is not uninhabited. An ancient native faction fiercely defends their home.

**Playable Factions:**

1. **Caldari** - A highly advanced magical-tech faction (inspired by Protoss/High Elves)

2. **Varnak** - Brutal, war-driven creatures with strong melee units (inspired by Orcs/Zerg)

3. **Dawnhold** - Strategic human-like settlers focused on balance and economics (inspired by Travian Romans)

**Non-Playable Faction:**  

1. **The Forgotten** - Ancient native defenders of the realm with powerful NPC-controlled villages and elite troops
